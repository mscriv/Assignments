# Assignment 18: Movie Querying script
* Use IMDB's movie querying script to create a command line app which prompts the user for a movie title
* Using the entered movie title, search via the API for the movie's plot
* Print the plot to the screen
* Also, open a CSV file and as the user continues to lookup movies, write the title and the plot to this CSV file
